|===
| Quality Goal | Explanation & Motivation
| Usability | The main goal of this project is to be convenient for teachers and students alike. This is key for acquiring users in the early phase.
| Reliability | We manage data that is potentially used to grade students. It is important that data never gets lost. Unintended downtimes are also not acceptable.
| Security | We manage personal data of students and provide a basis for grading. It is thus important that certain data can not be read or manipulated without proper permission.
| Maintainability | The project is intended to be maintained by the community. It must be accessible to as many developers as possible. This has an impact on the architecture, e.g. when chosing technologies.
